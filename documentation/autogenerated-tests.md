# Autogenerated Tests

There is some code to randomly generate test cases.  For now, these autogenerated test cases are limited to a small number of arithmetic expressions, almost all of which demonstrate variability on at least one flag.

This tool requires an additional package dependency, `numpy`.

```bash
pip install numpy
```

To run this generator, you will probably want an already initialized flit test directory (let's say it is located at `project/flit-tests`).

```bash
FLiT/gensrc/gensrc.py --outdir project/flit-tests/tests 1
```
