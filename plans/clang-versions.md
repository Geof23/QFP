# Compiler Versions

When I ran the experiment during the summer (April 2017), I used Clang version 4.0.0, which was release on 13 March 2017.  For the run being done on 21 March 2018, I am using Clang version 5.0.1 which was released on 21 December 2017.  I would like to use Clang version 6.0.0 that was released on 08 March 2018.  I get the release dates from the [LLVM Releases page](http://releases.llvm.org).

|---------------|--------|--------|---------|
| 13 March 2017 | v4.0.0 | v4.9.2 | v16.0.1 |
| 21 March 2018 | v5.0.1 | v7.3.1 | v18.0.1 |
