# FLiT Bisect Plan

The user adds custom build specifications to `custom.mk`.  I would want to
leverage this customization as well as the customization in the
`flit-config.toml` file.  I think this can be done in an automatic way to use
this bisect functionality and identify all compilations that cause differences.
